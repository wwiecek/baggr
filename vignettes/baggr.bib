  abstract = {We review the Akaike, deviance, and Watanabe-Akaike information criteria from a Bayesian perspective, where the goal is to estimate expected out-of-sample-prediction error using a biascorrected adjustment of within-sample error. We focus on the choices involved in setting up these measures, and we compare them in three simple examples, one theoretical and two applied. The contribution of this review is to put all these information criteria into a Bayesian predictive context and to better understand, through small examples, how these methods can apply in practice.},

  abstract = {Winner of the 2016 De Groot Prize from the International Society for Bayesian Analysis Now in its third edition, this classic book is widely considered the leading text on Bayesian methods, lauded for its accessible, practical approach to analyzing data and solving research problems. Bayesian Data Analysis, Third Edition continues to take an applied approach to analysis using up-to-date Bayesian methods. The authors\textemdash{}all leaders in the statistics community\textemdash{}introduce basic concepts from a data-analytic perspective before presenting advanced methods. Throughout the text, numerous worked examples drawn from real applications and research emphasize the use of Bayesian inference in practice. New to the Third Edition   Four new chapters on nonparametric modeling Coverage of weakly informative priors and boundary-avoiding priors Updated discussion of cross-validation and predictive information criteria Improved convergence monitoring and effective sample size calculations for iterative simulation Presentations of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, variational Bayes, and expectation propagation New and revised software code   The book can be used in three different ways. For undergraduate students, it introduces Bayesian inference starting from first principles. For graduate students, the text presents effective current approaches to Bayesian modeling and computation in statistics and related fields. For researchers, it provides an assortment of Bayesian methods in applied statistics. Additional materials, including data sets used in the examples, solutions to selected exercises, and software instructions, are available on the book's web page.},

  title = {Estimation in {{Parallel Randomized Experiments}}},
  volume = {6},
  issn = {0362-9791},
  abstract = {[Many studies comparing new treatments to standard treatments consist of parallel randomized experiments. In the example considered here, randomized experiments were conducted in eight schools to determine the effectiveness of special coaching programs for the SAT. The purpose here is to illustrate Bayesian and empirical Bayesian techniques that can be used to help summarize the evidence in such data about differences among treatments, thereby obtaining improved estimates of the treatment effect in each experiment, including the one having the largest observed effect. Three main tools are illustrated: 1) graphical techniques for displaying sensitivity within an empirical Bayes framework, 2) simple simulation techniques for generating Bayesian posterior distributions of individual effects and the largest effect, and 3) methods for monitoring the adequacy of the Bayesian model specification by simulating the posterior predictive distribution in hypothetical replications of the same treatments in the same eight schools.]},

  title = {Aggregating {{Distributional Treatment Effects}}: {{A Bayesian Hierarchical Analysis}} of the {{Microcredit Literature}}},
  shorttitle = {Aggregating {{Distributional Treatment Effects}}},
  abstract = {This paper develops methods to aggregate evidence on distributional treatment effects from multiple studies conducted in different settings, and applies them to the microcredit literature. Several randomized trials of expanding access to microcredit found substantial effects on the tails of household outcome distributions, but the extent to which these findings generalize to future settings was not known. Aggregating the evidence on sets of quantile effects poses additional challenges relative to average effects because distributional effects must imply monotonic quantiles and pass information across quantiles. Using a Bayesian hierarchical framework, I develop new models to aggregate distributional effects and assess their generalizability. For continuous outcome variables, the methodological challenges are addressed by applying transforms to the unknown parameters. For partially discrete variables such as business profits, I use contextual economic knowledge to build tailored parametric aggregation models. I find generalizable evidence that microcredit has negligible impact on the distribution of various household outcomes below the 75th percentile, but above this point there is no generalizable prediction. Thus, while microcredit typically does not lead to worse outcomes at the group level, there is no generalizable evidence on whether it improves group outcomes. Households with previous business experience account for the majority of the impact and see large increases in the right tail of the consumption distribution.},
