\usage{
funnel_plot(bg, show = c("inputs", "posterior"), level = 0.95,
  label = FALSE, covariate = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{bg}{a \code{\link[=baggr]{baggr()}} model}

\item{show}{whether to plot raw study-level inputs (\code{"inputs"}) or
posterior summaries (\code{"posterior"})}

\item{level}{confidence level for reference lines}

\item{label}{logical: add study/group labels?}

\item{covariate}{optional name of a column in the input data to use for
colouring points; ignored (with a warning) if the column is absent}
}
\value{
A ggplot funnel plot for the supplied model
}
\description{
Funnel plots for baggr models

\details{
Funnel plots are diagnostic visuals for meta-analyses: they plot study
standard errors (or precisions) on the vertical axis against estimated
treatment effects on the horizontal axis. Under the assumption of no
publication bias or heterogeneity-driven asymmetry, the points should
form a roughly symmetric inverted funnel around the pooled effect line.

For baggr models that include covariates (meta-regressions), the plotted
study effects already incorporate the covariate adjustments used in the
model.

bg <- baggr(schools, iter = 500, refresh = 0)
funnel_plot(bg, label = TRUE)
