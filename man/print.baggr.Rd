\title{S3 print method for objects of class \code{baggr} (model fits)}
\usage{
\method{print}{baggr}(x, exponent = FALSE, digits = 2, prob = 0.95, group, fixed = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{object of class \code{baggr}}

\item{exponent}{if \code{TRUE}, results (for means) are converted to exp scale}

\item{digits}{Number of significant digits to print.}

\item{prob}{Width of uncertainty interval (defaults to 95\%)}

\item{group}{logical; print group effects? If unspecified,
they are printed only if
less than 20 groups are present}

\item{fixed}{logical: print fixed effects?}

\item{...}{currently unused by this package: further arguments passed

}
\description{
This prints a concise summary of the main \code{\link[=baggr]{baggr()}} model features.
More info is included in the summary of the model and its attributes.
When the model supports publication selection (currently \code{"rubin"}), the
printout also reports the posterior summaries of the relative publication
probability across the |z|-intervals defined in the selection model.
