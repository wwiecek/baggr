\arguments{
\item{data}{data frame with summary or individual level data to meta-analyse}

\item{model}{if \code{NULL}, detected automatically from input data
otherwise choose from
\code{"rubin"}, \code{"mutau"}, \code{"individual"}, \code{"quantiles"}
(see Details).}

\item{pooling}{Type of pooling;
choose from \code{"none"}, \code{"partial"} (default) and \code{"full"}.
If you are not familiar with the terms, consult the vignette;
"partial" can be understood as random effects and "full" as fixed effects}

\item{effect}{Label for effect. Will default to "mean" in most cases, "log OR" in logistic model,
quantiles in \code{quantiles} model etc.
These labels are used in various print and plot outputs.
Comparable models (e.g. in \link{baggr_compare}) should have same \code{effect}.}

\item{prior_hypermean}{prior distribution for hypermean; you can use "plain text" notation like
\code{prior_hypermean=normal(0,100)} or \code{uniform(-10, 10)}.
See Details:Priors below for more possible specifications.
If unspecified, the priors will be derived automatically based on data
(and printed out in the console).}

\item{prior_hypersd}{prior for hyper-standard deviation, used
by Rubin and \verb{"mutau"`` models; same rules apply as for }_hypermean`;}

\item{prior_hypercor}{prior for hypercorrelation matrix, used by the \code{"mutau"} model}

\item{covariates}{Character vector with column names in \code{data}. The corresponding columns are used as
covariates (fixed effects) in the meta-regression model.}

\item{prior}{alternative way to specify all priors as a named list with \code{hypermean},
\code{hypersd}, \code{hypercor}, e.g. \code{prior = list(hypermean = normal(0,10))}}

\item{ppd}{logical; use prior predictive distribution? (\emph{p.p.d.}) Default is no.
If \code{ppd=TRUE}, Stan model will sample from the prior distributions
and ignore \code{data} in inference. However, \code{data} argument might still
be used to infer the correct model and to set the default priors.}

\item{test_data}{data for cross-validation; NULL for no validation, otherwise a data frame
with the same columns as \code{data} argument}

\item{quantiles}{if \code{model = "quantiles"}, a vector indicating which quantiles of data to use
(with values between 0 and 1)}

\item{outcome}{character; column name in (individual-level)
\code{data} with outcome variable values}

\item{group}{character; column name in \code{data} with grouping factor;
it's necessary for individual-level data, for summarised data
it will be used as labels for groups when displaying results}

\item{treatment}{character; column name in (individual-level) \code{data} with treatment factor;}

\item{warn}{print an additional warning if Rhat exceeds 1.05}

\item{...}{extra options passed to Stan function, e.g. \code{control = list(adapt_delta = 0.99)},
number of iterations etc.}
}
\value{
\code{baggr} class structure: a list including Stan model fit
alongside input data, pooling metrics, various model properties.
If test data is used, mean value of -2*lpd is reported as \code{mean_lpd}
}
\description{
Bayesian inference on parameters of an average treatment effects model
that's appropriate to the supplied
individual- or group-level data, using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo in Stan.

}
\details{
Running \code{baggr} requires 1/ data preparation, 2/ choice of model, 3/ choice of priors.
All three are discussed in depth in the package vignette (\code{vignette("baggr")}).

\strong{Data.} For aggregate data models you need a data frame with columns
\code{tau} and \code{se} or \code{tau}, \code{mu}, \code{se.tau}, \code{se.mu}.
An additional column can be used to provide labels for each group
(by default column \code{group} is used if available, but this can be
customised -- see the example below).
For individual level data three columns are needed: outcome, treatment, group. These
are identified by using the \code{outcome}, \code{treatment} and \code{group} arguments.

When working with individual-level data,
many data preparation steps (summarising, standardisation etc.)
can be done through a helper function \link{prepare_ma}.
Using it will also automatically format data inputs to be
work with \code{baggr()}.

\strong{Models.} Available models are:
\itemize{
\item for the means: \code{"rubin"} model for average treatment effect, \code{"mutau"}
version which takes into account means of control groups, \code{"full"},
which works with individual-level data
\item "quantiles" model is also available (see Meager, 2019 in references)
}

If no model is specified, the function tries to infer the appropriate
model automatically.
Additionally, the user must specify type of pooling.
The default is always partial pooling.

\strong{Priors.} It is optional to specify priors yourself,
as the package will try propose an appropriate
prior for the input data if you do not pass a \code{prior} argument.
To set the priors yourself, use \code{prior_} arguments. For specifying many priors at once
(or re-using between models), a single \code{prior = list(...)} argument can be used instead.
Appropriate examples are given in \code{vignette("baggr")}.

\strong{Outputs.} Standard functions for analysing the \code{baggr} object are
\itemize{
\item \link{treatment_effect} for distribution of hyperparameters
\item \link{group_effects} for distributions of group-specific parameters
\item \link{fixed_effects} for coefficients in meta-regression
\item \link{effect_draw} and \link{effect_plot} for posterior predictive distributions
\item \link{baggr_compare} for comparing multiple \code{baggr} models
\item \link{loocv} for cross-validation
}

df_pooled <- data.frame("tau" = c(1, -1, .5, -.5, .7, -.7, 1.3, -1.3),
                        "se" = rep(1, 8),
                        "state" = datasets::state.name[1:8])
baggr(df_pooled) #baggr automatically detects the input data
# correct labels, different pooling & passing some options to Stan
baggr(df_pooled, group = "state", pooling = "full", iter = 500)
#change the priors:
baggr(df_pooled, prior_hypermean = normal(5,5))

# "mu & tau" model, using a built-in dataset
# prepare_ma() can summarise individual-level data
