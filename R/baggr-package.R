#' baggr - a package for Bayesian meta-analysis
#'
#' This is _baggr_ (pronounced as _bagger_ or _badger_), a Bayesian meta-analysis
#' package for R that uses [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) to fit the models.
#' _Baggr_ is intended to be user-friendly and transparent so that
#' it's easier to understand the models you are building and criticise them.
#'
#' _Baggr_ package provides a suite of models that work with both summary data and full data sets,
#' to synthesise evidence collected from different groups, contexts or time periods.
#' The [baggr] command automatically detects the data type and, by default, fits a partial
#' pooling model (which you may know as
#' [random effects models](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/4700/what-is-the-difference-between-fixed-effect-random-effect-and-mixed-effect-mode))
#' with weakly informative priors by calling [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) to carry
#' out Bayesian inference. Modelling of variances or quantiles, standardisation and
#' transformation of data are also possible.
