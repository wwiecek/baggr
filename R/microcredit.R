#' 7 studies on effect of microcredit supply
#'
#' This dataframe contains the data used in Meager (2019) to estimate hierarchical
#' models on the data from 7 randomized controlled trials of expanding access to microcredit.
#'
#' The columns include the group indicator which gives the name of the lead author
#' on each of the respective studies, the value of the 6 outcome variables of most
#' interest (consumer durables spending, business expenditures, business profit,
#' business revenues, temptation goods spending and consumption spending) all of
#' which are standardised to USD PPP in 2009 dollars per two weeks (these are flow variables),
#' and finally a treatment assignment status indicator.
#'
#' The dataset has not otherwise been cleaned and therefore includes NAs and other
#' issues common to real-world datasets.
#'
#' For more information on how and why these variables were chosen and standardised,
#' see Meager (2019) or consult the associated code repository which includes the
#' standardisation scripts:

#' Simplified version of the microcredit dataset.

#' The columns include the group indicator which gives the name of the lead author on
#' each of the respective studies, the value of the household consumption
#' spending standardised to USD PPP in 2009 dollars per two weeks (these are flow variables),
#' and finally a treatment assignment status indicator.

#' A classic example of aggregate level continuous data in Bayesian hierarchical modelling.
#' This dataframe contains a column of estimated treatment effects of an SAT prep
#' program implemented in 8 different schools in the US, and a column of estimated standard errors.
