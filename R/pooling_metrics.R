#' Pooling metrics and related statistics for baggr
#'
#' Compute statistics relating to
#' `pooling` in a given [baggr] meta-analysis model returns statistics, for
#' either the entire model or individual groups, such as
#' pooling statistic by Gelman & Pardoe (2006), _I-squared_, _H-squared_, or study weights;
#' `heterogeneity` is a shorthand for `pooling(type = "total")`
#' `weights` is shorthand for `pooling(metric = "weights")`
#'
#' @param bg a [baggr] model
#' @param metric `"pooling"` for Gelman & Pardoe statistic _P_,
#'               `"isq"` for I-squared statistic (_1-P_, Higgins & Thompson, 2002)
#'               `"hsq"` for H squared statistic (_1/P_, ibid.);
#'               `"weights"` for study weights;
#'               also see _Details_
#' @param type In `pooling` calculation is done for each of the `"groups"`
#'            (default) or for `"total"` hypereffect(s).
#' @param summary logical; if `FALSE` a whole vector of pooling values is returned,
#'                otherwise only the means and intervals
#'
#' @details
#'
#' Pooling statistic (Gelman & Pardoe, 2006) describes the extent to which
#' group-level estimates of treatment
#' effect are "pooled" toward average treatment effect in the meta-analysis model.
#' If `pooling = "none"` or `"full"` (which you specify when calling [baggr]),
#' then the values are always 0 or 1, respectively.
#' If `pooling = "partial"`, the value is somewhere between 0 and 1.
#' We can distinguish between pooling of individual groups and overall pooling in
#' the model.
#'
#' In many contexts, i.e. medical statistics, it is typical to report _1-P_, called \eqn{I^2}
#' (see Higgins and Thompson, 2002; sometimes another statistic, \eqn{H^2 = 1 / P},
#' is used).
#' Higher values of _I-squared_ indicate higher heterogeneity;
#' Von Hippel (2015) provides useful details for _I-squared_ calculations (and some
#' issues related to it, especially in frequentist models).
#' See Gelman & Pardoe (2006) Section 1.1 for a short explanation of how \eqn{R^2}
#' statistic relates to the pooling metric.
#'
#' @section Group pooling:
#'
#' This is the calculation done by `pooling()` if `type = "groups"` (default).
#' In a partial pooling model (see [baggr] and above), group _k_ (e.g. study) has
#' standard error of treatment effect estimate, \eqn{se_k}.
#' The treatment effect (across _k_ groups) is variable across groups, with
#' hyper-SD parameter \eqn{\sigma_(\tau)}.
#'
#' The quantity of interest is ratio of variation in treatment effects to the
#' total variation.
#' By convention, we subtract it from 1, to obtain a _pooling metric_ _P_.
#'
#' \deqn{p = 1 - (\sigma_(\tau)^2 / (\sigma_(\tau)^2 + se_k^2))}
#'
#' * If \eqn{p < 0.5}, the variation across studies is higher than variation within studies.
#' * Values close to 1 indicate nearly full pooling. Variation across studies dominates.
#' * Values close to 0 indicate no pooling. Variation within studies dominates.
#'
#' Note that, since \eqn{\sigma_{\tau}^2} is a Bayesian parameter (rather than a
#' single fixed value),
#' _P_ is also a parameter. It is typical for _P_ to have very high dispersion,
#' as in many cases we
#' cannot precisely estimate \eqn{\sigma_{\tau}}. To obtain samples from the distribution
#' of _P_ (rather than summarised values), set `summary=FALSE`.
#'
#'
#' @section Study weights:
#'
#' Contributions of each group (e.g. each study) to the mean meta-analysis estimate
#' can be calculated by calculating for each study *w_k* the inverse of sum of group-specific
#' SE squared and between-study variation.
#' To obtain weights, this vector (across all studies) has to be normalised to 1, i.e.
#' *w_k/sum(w_k)* for each _k_.
#'
#' SE is typically treated as a fixed quantity
#' (and usually reported on the reported point estimate),
#' but between-study variance is a model parameter,
#' hence the weights themselves are also random variables.
#'
#'
#'
#'
#' @section Overall pooling in the model:
#'
#' Typically researchers want to report a single measure from the model,
#' relating to heterogeneity across groups.
#' This is calculated by either `pooling(mymodel, type = "total")` or simply
#' `heterogeneity(mymodel)`
#'
#' Formulae for the calculations below are provided in main package vignette and
#' almost analogous to the group calculation above, but using mean variance across
#' all studies. In other words, pooling _P_ is simply ratio of the expected within-study
#' variance term to total variance.
#'
#' The typical study variance is calculated following Eqn. (1) and (9)
#' in Higgins and Thompson (see References). We use this formulation
#' to make our pooling and I^2 comparable with other meta-analysis implementations,
#' but users should be aware that this is only one possibility for calculating
#' that "typical" within-study variance.
#'
#' Same as for group-specific estimates, _P_ is a Bayesian parameter and its
#' dispersion can be high.
#'
#'
#' @section Value:
#'
#' Matrix with mean and intervals for chosen pooling metric,
#' each row corresponding to one meta-analysis group.
